# Lemon Stats

A Discord bot that counts `lemon`

## Why does this exist???

In this Discord server I am in, there is this random tradition of spamming lemon. I decided to tabulate this, and because using the Search function for every user is not extremely fun, I decided to make a bot to do this automatically.

## Where is the bot token?

For security reasons (namely not getting my bot hijacked by random strangers), I have ommited the bot token from this repository. If you do want to use this code for a bot, however, simply make a `token.txt` file in the root directory and paste your token in there. The program should sort this out by itself. (if you don't have a token for your bot, [create a bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html) and get the token from the Discord Developer portal).

*(nice try but the token in the commits of yore no longer works)*
